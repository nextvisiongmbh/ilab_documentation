Criteria:
Determine if the 'actual output' is correct based on the 'expected output'.

Evaluation Steps:
[
    "Compare the actual output to the expected output for key values or results.",
    "Check if the format (data type, structure) of the actual output matches the expected output.",
    "Assess whether the actual output adheres to the requirements specified in the expected output.",
    "Determine if there are any discrepancies between the actual output and expected output, and classify them as acceptable or critical."
]

Score: 0.42186788465314795
Reason: While both outputs mention a persistent cough and fever, the actual output lacks specific details about other serious conditions and additional concerning signs, making it less comprehensive than the expected output.
